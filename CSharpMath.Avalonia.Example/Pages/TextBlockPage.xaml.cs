the fact that we reached this number in such a short amount of time is just phenomenal i-im just amazed, thank you all so much
for supporting this channel and helping it grow I-I love you guys, you guys are just awesome.
so as you can probably tell this isnt really a montage parody, this is really more like a kind thank you / update video
so in this video im quickly gonna go over two things: firstly advertisements, and more importantly : the future of this channel
and what kind of direction its headed.
okay so firstly, the advertisements. believe it or not but montage parodies are actually a copy right minefield
new content is getting claimed every day. we could use something from.. lets say.. 5 years ago, and tommorow a huge company could come along
and claim that video as theres and we have no control over that. and any video we use that product in could either get
copy right stiked or lose monetizeation, meaning that all the money made from that video would get sent to the company, and not
us. the only real way to counter this is to get advertisements placed on my channel, i mean its a win-win for everyone involved
you know i get a safety net generated for myself and the company gets exposure and you guys, my sub subcribers, sit through a two
second ad that will be as short and painless as possible, so next im gonna talk about the future of this channel, this doesnt mean in anyway that im actually quitting montage parodies, its basically why you subscribed to my channel and i enjoy making them and
theres no reason to quit because im in full time education i have less time to make and upload videos it use to be weekly uploads
and now its pretty much once a month but in my opinion uploading once a month isnt enough id like to upload more than that, i mean, as much as possible
but montage parodies take a long time to make, collecting the resources, coming up with an original idea ya know, all this stuff takes
time and planning and that combined with me being in education means that they take a while to make, a good video that goes into
detail about this is rubber rosses video 'future of independant animation on youtube' it is a different theme'd video because I
dont do independant animation, but you can still kind of relate because uploads become more infrequent; channel traffic slows down
this is why i want to make videos that are related to montage parodies, but arent exactly meta montage parodies, like I said before:
im not quitting montage parodies, its basically seen as either you wait for me to upload one video a month or i upload one video a month with a bunch of you know, funny gameplay stuff in between.A great example of this would be counter strike global offensive
but at the end of the day, its all down to you guys, you guys are my subscribers and id love to hear your feed back on what youd like me to do next,
leave a comment below: your thoughts and ideas. Im gonna try to respond to as many comments as I can to this video.I would love to
hear your feedback on what kind of videos youd want to see, any future ideas for the channel. I feel that because your subscribed
to an extent, you're inclined to, you know, share your thoughts and ideas, and have a say on what i should do next, and its really
appeciated guys.and lastly i want to thank you guys, thank you guys for helping this channel grow so quickly, in such a short amount of time
I mean I started doing videos like these just over a year ago and i would have never expected my channel to grow so quickly in such a short amount of time
