This text is made to be long enough to have the TextPainter of CSharpMath add a line break to this text automatically.
To demonstrate the capabilities of the TextPainter,
here are some math content:
First, a fraction in inline mode: $\frac34$
Next, a summation in inline mode: $\sum_{i=0}^3i^i$
Then, a summation in display mode: $$\sum_{i=0}^3i^i$$
After that, an integral in display mode: $$\int^6_{-56}x\ dx$$
Finally, an escaped dollar sign \$ that represents the start/end of math mode when it is unescaped.
Colors can be achieved via \backslash color\textit{\{color\}\{content\}}, or \backslash \textit{color\{content\}},
where \textit{color} stands for one of the LaTeX standard colors.
\red{Colored text in text mode are able to automatically break up when spaces are inside the colored text, which the equivalent in math mode cannot do.}
\textbf{Styled} \texttt{text} can be achieved via the LaTeX styling commands.
The SkiaSharp version of this is located at CSharpMath.SkiaSharp.TextPainter;
and the Xamarin.Forms version of this is located at CSharpMath.Forms.TextView.
Was added in 0.1.0-pre4; working in 0.1.0-pre5; fully tested in 0.1.0-pre6."/>
